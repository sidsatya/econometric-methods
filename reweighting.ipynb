    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the use and importance of reweighting methods in econometrics by analyzing regression results on the gender gap between the number of papers accepted to top journals by male and female economists. Data is from a very recent paper by Card, Della Vigna, Funk and Iriberri to examine gender differences in the probability that female versus male economists are selected to become Fellows of the Econometric Society - an honorific Society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reweighting methods are useful when you have a group of data that you want to perform analysis on with regards to a \"reference group.\" Once such example would be if you would like to compare the estimated earnings of males with regards to a males as a reference group. One drawback of running a simple OLS regression with a dummy for both groups is that there may be inherent differences in the distribution of each group that affects the overall results. In order to account for this, we can \"reweight\" the group of interest to match the distribution of the reference group by imagining a \"conterfactual\" world, where the group of interest has the same distribution of the reference group but retains the same mean within its group. This allows us to find out how much of the gap between means of groups is due to differences in distribution across categories as opposed to differences within individual categories.\n",

The adjusted selection gap uncovers how much of the actual gap between groups is caused by the distribution across categories $g$ as opposed to differences within categories. Thus, while the actual selection gap of the adjusted selection gap is a weighted average of the difference in probability of becoming a new fellow across categories of # of top 5 journal publications.\n",

    "Looking at the table from above where we calculated the mean within each group of becoming new fellows, we can infer that the reason we see a bigger positive effect for females when they are redistributed to look like men may be because of the way the men are distributed. There is a much higher fraction of all male economists with previous publications when compared to fraction of all female economists with previous publications when looking at those with >5 top5 publications. Thus, we can infer that those with higher numbers of top 5 publications would be more likely to become new fellows. By redistributing the females to look like men in this case, there is a larger positive effect for them to become new fellows if they have more top 5 journal publications. \n",

This analysis suggests that while the selection gap is small, each subgroup is selected according to a different criteria due to fundamental differences within each group. This data could speak towards a push for greater diversity within the Econometric Society, as well as provide a piece of evidence of how bias within the field of economics is being addressed. "
