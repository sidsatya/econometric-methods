# econometric-methods

A repository containing previous work and examples of methods used for econometric analysis. These examples are adapted from personal projects and class projects that I have completed over the years. This is meant to be a central store of these methods, so that I (and others) may look back on them for easy to understand examples of how to implement different types of econometric and statistical analysis.


**List of Examples** 
1. Bernoulli Sampling 
2. Binscatter
