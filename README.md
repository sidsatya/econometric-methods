# econometric-methods

A repository containing previous work and examples of methods/visualizations used for econometric analysis. These examples are adapted from personal projects and class projects that I have completed over the years. This is meant to be a central store of these methods, so that I (and others) may look back on them for easy to understand examples of how to implement different types of econometric and statistical analysis.

**Note:** It seems that GitHub does not display the Latex in some of the Jupyter notebook cells properly. As such, you will only be able to view the last 1-2 lines of analytics derivations that I have written when previewing the files. However, if you download the notebook, all Latex formulas should render properly :) 


**List of Examples** 
1. Bernoulli Sampling 
2. Binscatter
3. Omitted Variable Bias
4. Oaxaca Decomposition (in progress)
5. Reweighting I 
6. Reweighting II, logit and weights (in progress)
7. Instrumental Variables (in progress) 
8. Difference-in-Differences (in progress) 
9. Regression Discontinuity (in progress) 
10. Lasso and Ridge for Feature Selection (in progress)
